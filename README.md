**Horse Race Simulator**

This project, while not fully refined, serves as a demonstration of Java skills in both textual and graphical formats.

This project is a Horse Race Simulator created as part of the ECS414U module. It showcases Java skills with an emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and includes a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI). The project is divided into two parts: a text-based version with limited features, and a graphical version with more advanced functionality.


**Project Overview**

The project consists of two versions:

**Text-Based Version (text-version Branch):** A basic version of the Horse Race game with limited functionality, run purely in a terminal.

**GUI Version (gui-development Branch):** An advanced version of the game, with a graphical interface and additional features like race editing, viewing horses, and placing bets.


**Branches**

**gui-development Branch:** Contains the full graphical version of the Horse Race simulator.
**text-version Branch**: Contains the simpler, text-based version.


**Features**

Text-Based Version

A minimalistic simulation of a horse race.

Runs in the terminal with automatic progression of the race once initiated.

Limited interactivity and customization.


**GUI Version**
Provides a graphical interface for enhanced user interaction.

Allows you to:

Start a race: Simulates a horse race in real-time.

Edit a race: Customize race parameters like horses and tracks.

View horses: Check details of each horse participating in the race.

Place bets: Bet on the outcome of the race.

Interaction through tabs, with most options available when the race is not currently running.



How to Run

All files from INTELLIJ - so must be in src folder for GUI version for textfiles.


**Text-Based Version**

Download the Horse and Race classes from the text-version branch

Open these files in any Java IDE (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse) or a terminal with Java installed.

Compile and run the program. No interaction is required after starting the program, as the race runs automatically.


**GUI Version**

Download the src from gui-development branch

Ensure that the downloaded files and associated text files are placed in a folder labeled src.

Open the project with Java installed.

Run the Race class to start the GUI.

A Home page pop-up will appear.

From the Home page, you can navigate through the tabs:

Start: Runs the race simulation.

Edit Race: Modify race details.

View Horses: View horse information.

Bets: Place a bet on the race.

Note: Most tabs are accessible only when a race is not actively running.



**Future Improvements**

This project is a demonstration of Java OOP principles and GUI development, with room for improvement:

More customization options for races and horses.

Enhanced graphics for race simulations.

Better error handling and user feedback in the GUI.
